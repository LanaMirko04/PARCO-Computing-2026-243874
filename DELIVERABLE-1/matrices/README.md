# Matricies
This directory contains various matricies used for testing and benchmarking purposes.
Each matrix is generated by a specific [script](../tools/mmgen.py) (`memgen.py`) written in Python.

## Available Matrices
> [!NOTE]
> The matricies provided here are for testing purposes only and are not used in the simulation.

The following matrices are included in this directory:

- **`mm_matrix_10x4_density_0.10.mtx`**: A 10x4 matrix with a density of 10%.
- **`mm_matrix_100x100_density_0.10.mtx`**: A 100x100 matrix with a density of 10%.
- **`mm_matrix_1000x1000_density_0.10.mtx`**: A 1000x1000 matrix with a density of 10%.

## Matrix Generation
If you wish to generate your own matrices with different sizes or densities, you can use `mmgen.py` by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
$ python tools/memgen.py
```

Note that you have to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file before running the script. You can do this by executing:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Format
As required by the deliverable specification, all matrices are stored in the [Matrix Market](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html) format.
